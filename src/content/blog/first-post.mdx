# In the beginning...

Did God sit in the heavens staring at clouds and planning his creations for eons on end until finally unleashing his perfect plan? Or was he the original tech bro who started iteratively, working from a chunk of mud? (Going off the suggestions on the youtube homepage I'm leaning towards iterative).

  format="gif"
  width={800}

  class="border-4 border-slate-900 shadow-lg"
  autoplay
  loop
/>

{/* auto height to maintain aspect ratio */}
